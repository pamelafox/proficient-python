        "Here are some ideas for ways you could change up your quiz system:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Shuffling**: You could shuffle the choices within a `MultipleChoiceAnswer` and/or shuffle the questions within an entire quiz. The `random` module has a `shuffle` function that'd be mighty useful for this!\n",
        "* **Timing**: You could add a maximum duration for each quiz, keeping track of when the user started, showing how much time was left after each question, and warning them when they go over. Check out the `time` module for some useful functions.\n",
        "* **Fuzzier answer matching**: If you don't want to penalize users for spelling mistakes, you could check whether their answer was close in spelling to the correct answer (perhaps using the Levenshtein edit distance).\n",
        "* **More answer types**: For example, you could add a type where users answer just 'True' or 'False', or you could introduce a type where users select multiple correct answers out of a list. Each class would inherit from `Answer`.\n",
        "* **Feedback**: Instead of just telling users they're right or wrong, you could give them per-answer feedback about why their answer isn't right. That would definitely involve a change to the `Answer` constructors and `Question` display, and some thinking about how you want to specify feedback for each answer type. In my experience, giving feedback on wrong answers is very helpful for students and worth the work involved.\n",
