<section class="getting-help">
  <h2>🙋🏾 Getting Help</h2>
  <p>While this course is designed to be as self-guided and supportive as possible, questions are totally expected! Here's how you can get help along the way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>💬 Ask in the community:</strong> Visit the 
      <a href="https://github.com/pamelafox/proficient-python/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Discussions</a> 
      board for the course to ask questions, share tips, or see what others have encountered.
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>🤖 Use AI tools thoughtfully:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT or Claude can be helpful if you're stuck, but try not to just ask them for the solution. Instead, share your code and ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Can you help me understand why this function isn't returning what I expect?"</li>
        <li>"Here's the error message I'm seeing. What could be causing it?"</li>
        <li>"I'm trying to loop through a list of strings—why isn't this working?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may need to even specifically add an instruction like "Do NOT give me the solution."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🙏 A note about support:</strong> Because this course is free and open, there's no dedicated 1-on-1 support.
    </li>
  </ul>
