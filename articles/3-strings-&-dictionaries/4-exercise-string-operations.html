<h1>Exercise: String operations</h1>
<p>Try out different string operations and methods in the following coding exercises. You probably want to keep the previous articles open in other tabs, as well as the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">Python string methods documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>String methods</h2>

<p>The next two exercises help you practice using string methods.</p>

<h3>Bleeper</h3>
<p>Implement <code>bleep_out</code>, a function that looks for a particular phrase in a string and returns a new string with that phrase replaced by '***'.</p>

<details>
  <summary>If you'd like more guidance, expand this block.</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Your function only needs a single line of code: one <strong><code>return</code></strong> statement.
    <li>The return statement should use the <code>replace</code> method on <code>string1</code>, passing in <code>string2</code> and the literal string <code>"***"</code>.
  </ul>
</details>
<code-exercise-element exercise-name="bleeper">def bleep_out(string1, string2):
  """Returns a version of string1 where all instances of string2
  have been replaced by "***".

  >>> bleep_out('i freaking love carrots', 'freaking')
  'i *** love carrots'
  >>> bleep_out('oh dang oh dang oh dang', 'dang')
  'oh *** oh *** oh ***'
  """
  return "" # REPLACE THIS LINE
</code-exercise-element>


<h3>Phone number formats</h3>
<p>Implement <code>phone_number_versions</code>, a function that turns a hyphen-separated phone number into a list containing that original number, a space-separated version of it, and a period-separated version.</p>

<details>
  <summary>If you'd like more guidance, expand this block.</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>As a first step, your function should split <code>phone_number</code> into parts, using the <code>split</code> method, and store the results in a list.
    <li>Then, the function should create a new list, where some of the items are made using the <code>join</code> method.
  </ul>
</details>
<code-exercise-element exercise-name="phone-number-versions">def phone_number_versions(phone_number):
    """
    Accepts a hyphen-separated phone number and returns
    a list containing the original version, a space-separated version,
    and a period-separated version.
    
    >>> phone_number_versions('1-800-867-5309')
    ['1-800-867-5309', '1 800 867 5309', '1.800.867.5309']
    """
    return [] # REPLACE THIS LINE
</code-exercise-element>


<h2>String slicing</h2>

<p>The next three exercises help you practice using string slicing.</p>

<h3>Mix up</h3>
<p>Implement <code>mix_up</code>, a function that concatenates two words, but swaps out the first 2 characters of each word. For example, 'mix' and 'pod' is turned into 'pox mid'.</p>
<code-exercise-element exercise-name="mix-up">def mix_up(word1, word2):
  """Returns the concatenation of word1 and word2 separated by a space,
  with the first 2 characters of each word swapped.
  Assumes the two words are at least 2 characters long.

  >>> mix_up('mix', 'pod')
  'pox mid'
  >>> mix_up('dog', 'dinner')
  'dig donner'
  """
  return ""  # REPLACE THIS LINE
</code-exercise-element>

<h3>Gerundio</h3>
<p>Implement <code>gerundio</code>, a function that transforms Spanish infinite verbs (such as "cantar" or "volver") into their gerund forms ("cantando" and "volviendo"). See the docstring for the transformation rules.</p>
<p>Once you get the initial tests passing, you can also implement this function for another language you know that has similar infinitive â†’ gerund verb form changes. Share it with the rest of us if you do!</p>
<code-exercise-element exercise-name="gerundio">def gerundio(verb):
  """Turns Spanish infinitive verbs (which end in "ar", "er", "ir")
  into the gerund forms (which end in "ando" or "iendo).
  When a verb ends in "ar", the "ar" is replaced with "ando".
  When a verb ends in "er" or "ir", the end is replaced with "iendo".

  >>> gerundio('cantar')
  'cantando'
  >>> gerundio('volver')
  'volviendo'
  >>> gerundio('abrir')
  'abriendo'
  >>> gerundio('armar')
  'armando'
  """
  return '' # REPLACE THIS LINE</code-exercise-element>

<h3>Not bad? Good!</h3>
<p>Implement <code>not_bad</code>, a function that replaces a phrase in a string that starts with  "not" and ends with "bad" into the single word "good".</p>
<code-exercise-element exercise-name="not-bad-good">def not_bad(sentence):
  """Returns a new string where the first substring in a sentence
  that starts with "not" and ends with "bad" is replaced by the word "good".
  Returns the original string if no matching substring is found.

  >>> not_bad('This dinner is not that bad!')
  'This dinner is good!'
  >>> not_bad('This movie is not so bad!')
  'This movie is good!'
  >>> not_bad('This dinner is bad!')
  'This dinner is bad!'
  """
  return '' # REPLACE THIS LINE
