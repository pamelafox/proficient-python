<h1>Exercise: Conditionals</h1>
<p>In this exercise, you'll define functions that consist entirely of compound conditionals (<code>if</code>/<code>elif</code>/<code>else</code>). Think carefully about the order of your conditions; sometimes order can have a big effect!</p>

<h3>Lesser Num</h3>
<p>ðŸ“º  Need help getting started on this one? Watch me go through a similar problem <link>in this video</link>.</p>

<code-exercise-element exercise-name="lesser-num">
def lesser_num(num1, num2):
    """ Returns whichever number is lowest of the two supplied numbers.

    >>> lesser_num(45, 10)
    10
    >>> lesser_num(-1, 30)
    -1
    >>> lesser_num(20, 20)
    20
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
</code-exercise-element>

<hr>
<h3>Hello World</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you'll use conditionals to translate a phrase into three different languages. Once you get the tests to pass, I encourage you to add another language you know!</p>

<code-exercise-element exercise-name="hello-world-language">def hello_world(language_code):
    """ Returns the translation of "Hello, World" into the language
    specified by the language code (e.g. "es", "pt", "en"),
    defaulting to English if an unknown language code is specified.
    >>> hello_world("en")
    'Hello, World'
    >>> hello_world("es")
    'Hola, Mundo'
    >>> hello_world("pt")
    'OlÃ¡, Mundo'
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE</code-exercise-element>

<h3>Grade Assigner</h3>
<code-exercise-element exercise-name="hello-world-language">def assign_grade(score):
    """ Returns a letter grade for the numeric score based on the grade bins of:
     "A" (90-100), "B" (80-89), "C" (70-79), "D" (65-69), or "F" (0-64)

    >>> assign_grade(95)
    'A'
    >>> assign_grade(90)
    'A'
    >>> assign_grade(85)

    >>> assign_grade(68)
    'D'
    >>> assign_grade(65)

    >>> assign_grade(64)
    'F'
    >>> assign_grade(0)
    'F'
    """
