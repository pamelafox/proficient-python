<h1>Exercise: Loops and lists</h1>
<p>Practice lists and loops in this set of exercises. A few of them have comments to guide you towards a solution; you can follow those comments if they help or delete them and start from scratch. Whatever works for you!</p>
<p>🙋🏽 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏿‍♂️  If you have any questions while working through the exercises, just post in the #exercises channel on Slack. For example, you can post "I'm looking for help with the Make Point exercise." and then post your code in the thread (so as to not reveal the answer for those who haven't worked on it yet). Please post when you have questions, we're here to help!</p>
<h3>Make point</h3>
<p>Implement <code>make_point</code>, a function that returns a list with the two arguments <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, each rounded to integer values.</p>
<p><italic>Hint: Remember one of Python's </italic><link><italic>built-in functions</link></italic><italic> makes it easy to round numbers.</italic></p>
