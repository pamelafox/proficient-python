<h1>Weekly overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to the second week of learning Python! Don't worry if your mind is a little bit blown, learning programming can be like that. 🤯Just keep at it, and reach out to the community when you need help.</p>
<p>Our learning goals for this week are:</p>
<ul><li><p>Loops</p></li>
<li><p>Ranges</p></li>
<li><p>Lists</p></li>
<li><p>List mutation</p></li>
<li><p>Nested lists</p></li></ul>
<p>At the end, you'll use your newfound knowledge to build a bunch of photo filters, like grayscale and inversion, and apply them to whatever photo you'd like.</p>
<p>We recommend this schedule to stay on track:</p>
<ul><li><p>Monday: Join us for live lecture 👩🏻‍🏫</p></li>
<li><p>Tuesday: Work through loops, ranges, and lists</p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday: Work through list mutation and nested lists</p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday/Thursday: Join us for project party 🎉 (Wed 9PM PT or Thurs 9AM PT)</p></li>
<li><p>Friday-Saturday: Finish up project</p></li></ul>
