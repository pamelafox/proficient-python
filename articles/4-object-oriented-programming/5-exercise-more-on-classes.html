<h1>Exercise: More on classes</h1>
<p>These exercises will give you practice with class variables and class methods.</p>
<h2>Missing class variables</h2>
<p>In the first two exercises, the class definitions are missing a class variable. Read the docstring and doctests to determine the name and value of the missing class variable, add it in, and run the doctests after.</p>
<h3>Exercise: StudentGrade</h3>
<p>üì∫ Need help with this one? Watch a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFHKyVkn5mQ">video walkthrough</a> of the solution. Then try it out yourself and apply what you learned to the next exercise.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Article</h3>
<code-exercise-element name="article-class" show-tests>class Article:
  """Represents an article on an educational website.

<h2>Class methods</h2>
<h3>Exercise: Thneed Factory</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you'll finish the implementation of <code>make_thneed</code>, a class method that can make Thneeds of a given size and a random color.</p>
<p><strong>Hint: </strong>You can use<strong> </strong><code>random.choice(list)</code> to generate a random color from a list of colors.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Cat adoption</h3>
<p>For this exercise, you'll finish the implementation of <code>adopt_random_cat</code>, a class method that can generate new cats. Just what we need in the world! üêà‚Äç‚¨õüêà</p>
<p><strong>Hint: </strong>You can use<strong> </strong><code>random.choice(list)</code> to generate a random name from a list of names and <code>random.randrange(start, stop)</code> to generate a random number of lives.</p>
