<h1>Exercise: Classes</h1>
<p>In the following exercises, you'll implement the <code>__init__</code> and other methods of a class. Make sure you first read through the class doctests to see what instance variables and methods are expected to exist on each class.</p>

<h2>Plant</h2>
<p>Finish the implementation of <code>Plant</code>, a class that can be used by a plant nursery to track which plants they have in inventory and how many they have of each plant.</p>
<p>üì∫ Need help with this one? Watch a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/9d0LjvCD6GE">video walkthrough</a> of the solution. Then try it out yourself and apply what you learned to the exercises after.</p>
<p>üß© Or, for a different form of guidance, try a <a target="_blank" href="https://pamelafox.github.io/faded-parsons-static/problem.html?name=plant">Parsons Puzzle version</a> first.</p>

<h2>MoviePurchase</h2>
<p>Finish the implementation of  <code>MoviePurchase</code>, a class that represents movie purchases on YouTube, tracking the title and costs of each movie bought, plus the number of times watched.</p>
